# Ken Shen - Live Project

## Intro
To close out my time at the Tech Academy, I participated in a two week sprint developing a full-scale C# web application in a MVC/MVVM framework with a team of my peers. I had the opportunity to apply my problem solving and root-cause analysis skills towards real-world business needs and complete a number of stories implementing front end and back end solutions.

Below are a few of my contributions to the project, as well as my contact details.
